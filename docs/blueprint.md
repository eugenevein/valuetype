# **App Name**: Value Type Generator

## Core Features:

- Value Type Determination: AI powered selector tool to determine Value Types (Level of Urgency, Market Impact, Strategic, Maximise Revenue, Minimise Cost) based on user input. The LLM will use this tool to choose the correct value type.
- Input Forms: User input form to specify attributes related to the value type. There's a checklist for each value type of high, mid and low. Also a free text field for each value type. There's also one field across all types, one for all five - what would happen if we donâ€™t work on the epic right now?
- Result Display: Output should display selected value types for each of five value type categories in an easy-to-read layout. High should have red background, mid yellow and low green.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a calming blue (#3498db) to represent trust and stability.
- Secondary color: A neutral grey (#ecf0f1) for backgrounds and less important elements.
- Accent: A vibrant green (#2ecc71) to highlight key actions and results.
- Clean and professional typography for clarity.
- Simple, intuitive layout for ease of use.
- Use recognizable icons for each value type to improve understanding.
